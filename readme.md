# AI Algorithms Collection

This repository contains a set of beginner-friendly AI algorithm projects implemented in Python. Each project is organized into its own folder and includes examples, explanations, and basic usage.

## Included Projects

- **Linear Regression** – A foundational machine learning algorithm for predicting continuous values.
- **Logistic Regression** – A classification algorithm used to predict binary outcomes.
- **Probability Distributions** – Explorations of key probability distributions used in statistics and machine learning.

Each folder contains:
- Source code
- Sample datasets (if applicable)
- Explanation and usage instructions

## Getting Started

To run any of the projects:
1. Navigate into the project directory.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if available).
3. Run the main script (usually `main.py` or `notebook.ipynb`).
